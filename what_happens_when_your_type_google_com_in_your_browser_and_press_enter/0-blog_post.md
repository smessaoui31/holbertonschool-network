# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?

This is a classic interview question that tests your knowledge of how the web stack works. Let‚Äôs walk through it step by step in **beginner-friendly language**.

---

## 1. DNS Request (Domain Name System)

- You type `https://www.google.com` in your browser.  
- Your computer needs the **IP address** of Google‚Äôs servers (computers only talk in IPs, not names).  
- The browser asks the **DNS system**: ‚ÄúWhat is the IP of `www.google.com`?‚Äù  
- DNS servers reply with something like: `142.250.190.4` (an example IP).  

üëâ **DNS = the Internet‚Äôs phonebook.**

---

## 2. TCP/IP (How computers talk on the Internet)

- Now that your computer has the IP, it needs to **connect**.  
- The Internet uses the **TCP/IP protocol**:
  - **IP** = address of the machine.  
  - **TCP** = rules to create a reliable connection (like making sure every packet arrives in the right order).  
- Your computer opens a **TCP connection** to Google‚Äôs server on port **443** (the port for HTTPS).  

üëâ Think of TCP/IP as the **rules of the road** that all devices follow to send/receive data.

---

## 3. Firewall (Security Guard)

- Before traffic can pass, it may go through **firewalls**:
  - On your computer
  - At your ISP
  - At Google‚Äôs data center  
- Firewalls act like **security guards**: they block bad traffic and only let through what‚Äôs allowed (for example, port 443 for HTTPS).

---

## 4. HTTPS/SSL (Encryption)

- The browser and Google‚Äôs server perform an **SSL/TLS handshake**.  
- They exchange keys and set up **encryption**.  
- From now on, all communication is **encrypted** so no one (like hackers or your ISP) can read or tamper with your data.  

üëâ This is why you see the **padlock icon** in your browser.

---

## 5. Load Balancer (Traffic Director)

- Google doesn‚Äôt run on one computer ‚Äî it runs on thousands.  
- Your request first hits a **load balancer**.  
- The load balancer decides which actual Google server should handle your request (based on things like location, server load, or health checks).  

üëâ Think of it as the **traffic cop** that sends you to the right lane.

---

## 6. Web Server (First Stop)

- The request arrives at a **web server** (e.g., Nginx or Apache).  
- The web server:
  - Handles HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
  - Serves static files (like images or CSS).
  - For dynamic requests, it forwards your request to the **application server**.

---

## 7. Application Server (The Brain)

- The **application server** runs the actual Google code.  
- It decides what content to send back:
  - For example, if you searched something, it processes your query.
  - It may need to talk to a **database** for information.

---

## 8. Database (The Memory)

- If the app needs stored data, it queries the **database**.  
- Example: your search history, or Google‚Äôs giant index of the web.  
- The database quickly retrieves this information and returns it to the application server.

---

## 9. Response Back to You

- The **application server** builds a response (like the Google homepage or search results).  
- It passes it back through the **web server ‚Üí load balancer ‚Üí the Internet ‚Üí your computer**.  
- Your browser receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then **renders the page** on your screen.

## 10. Summary

When you press Enter on `https://www.google.com`:

1. DNS translates the domain name to an IP address.  
2. TCP/IP creates a connection to that IP.  
3. Firewalls allow safe traffic through.  
4. HTTPS encrypts the connection.  
5. A load balancer chooses which server handles you.  
6. A web server receives the request.  
7. An application server processes the logic.  
8. A database provides the data.  
9. The response comes back and your browser displays Google.  

üëâ All of this happens in a **fraction of a second**!

## Why This Matters

This question is common in interviews because it tests if you understand the **big picture** of how the web works.  
Even as a beginner, being able to explain this step by step shows strong **fundamentals**.
